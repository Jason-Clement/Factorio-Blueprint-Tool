A tool to import a blueprint string from the clipboard, reflect it vertically or horizontally and/or upgrade/downgrade components, and then export back to the clipboard.

[Version 0.1](https://github.com/Jason-Clement/Factorio-Blueprint-Tool/releases/download/v0.1/Factorio-Blueprint-Tool.zip)

## Instructions

Paste the blueprint string into the left box (or just click the Paste button when the blueprint is in your clipboard) and then click one of the various icons at the top.  The right textbox displays what happened. To export back to Factorio, either copy the blueprint string from the left box or press the Copy button.

Transport belt replacements also replace underground belts and splitters.

The encode and decode buttons will take the blueprint string on the left and convert it to its raw json on the right, and vice versa.
